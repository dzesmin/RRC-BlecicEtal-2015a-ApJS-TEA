This is the compendium of the TEA theory paper, Blecic et al. (2015) 
"TEA: A code for calculating thermochemical equilibrium abundances". 
The paper is submitted to the ApJ Supplemental Series in May, 2015.
The arXiv version can be found on http://arxiv.org/.

The TEA version used to produce the results from this paper is located at:
https://github.com/dzesmin/TEA/releases/tag/1.0-alpha

The directories in this compendium are named according to the figures 
and tables numbers from the paper. Each directory contains data, source
files, and the code to reproduce the figures and tables data. The 
instructions how to run the code are given in the directories' README files. 

Figure 1 and 2,  illustration of the Lagrangian  minimization approach
and the Lambda correction algorithm, are drawn in Skechup 3D and Photoshop
without using real data. Figure 3 is the layout of the TEA package and it 
is drawn using Lucid-chart online program: www.lucidchart.com.

The material needed to reproduce the rest of the figures and tables can be
found in the respective directories.
